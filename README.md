# CheckersInMatlabForAI
A first attempt at creating a light-weight virtual enviornment for AI programming, 
specifically hoping to take advantage of the Neural Net packages in MATLAB.

The bare-bones of the game is finished, with most crippling bugs removed. The current development of the project
allows for the user to edit the "unfinished" matlab function which contains the decision making process for the AI.

Still quite a bit of tinkering to do, discrete-level neural nets are an interesting and contemporary problem.

Feel free to leave me a message with thoughts/ideas.
